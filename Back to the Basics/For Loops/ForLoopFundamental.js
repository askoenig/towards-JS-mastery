// Using a for loop, decrement countDown by one each time the loop runs until it equals 0, making use of looping functionality instead of logging each number separately.

let countDown = 10;
// ADD CODE HERE
for (let i = 1; i <= countDown; countDown--) {}
// Uncomment the below line to check your work
console.log(countDown); // -> should print 0;
